# DESPTRN

This Github repository is a collection of machine problems in our class, DESPTRN. In a gist, it's a class that solely revolves around software design patterns and how we might utilize them in different scenarios.

Initially, we were tasked to brainstorm an e-commerce platform wherein we would use the software design patterns that we've learned to gradually create a full-fledged system. Thus, enter Josh and Josh's Sandwiches.
