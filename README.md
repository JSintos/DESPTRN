# DESPTRN

This Github repository is a collection of pair programming machine problems in our class, DESPTRN. In a gist, it's a class that solely revolves around software design patterns and how we might utilize them in different scenarios.

## How it works

Initially, we were tasked to brainstorm on an e-commerce platform. Every week or so, we learn about a new software design pattern. As part of the homework for the week, we are then tasked to integrate the newly-learned software design pattern in some way, gradually creating a full-fledged system. Thus, enter Josh &amp; Josh's Sandwiches.
